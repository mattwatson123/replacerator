replacerator
=====

Having grown weary of forking cloud-to-butt whenever I needed to get my `s/from/to/g` fix on, I just made an extension that lets you define rules in the options page.

![screenshot of options page](screenshot_options.png?raw=true)


fun features
-----
- json loader/dumper for rulesharing
- regex match
- write arbitrary JS replacement functions; comes preloaded with an example cm-to-inch converter


todo
-----
- some way to set precedence for rules which are substrings of each other
- download font-awesome instead of importing from CDN plz
