replacerator
=====

Having grown weary of forking cloud-to-butt whenever I needed to get my `s/from/to/g` fix on, I just made an extension that lets you define rules in the options page.

fun features
-----
- Comes preloaded with cloud-to-butt, and "political correctness" to "treating people with respect".
- json loader/dumper for rulesharing


todo
-----
- enforce acyclic graph so it's impossible to define rules that cycle forever
- some way to set precedence for rules which are substrings of each other
- make entries editable instead of having to retype from & to
